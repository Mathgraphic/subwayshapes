Here you can find the shape files with subway lines for all underground systems
of cities over former Soviet Union area (the name of the file corresponds to a
city subway system) â€“ Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, Armenia, Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Georgia.

In contrast to OSM data, our shape files support single-track subway lines
whereas OSM provides two tracks for each subway line. Sometimes it causes
inconvenience for users especially then you don`t want to overload your map
with additional data.

You can easily change the attributes of the files (for ex. color, opacity,
texture etc.) for different visualization needs.
